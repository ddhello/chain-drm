A concept for implementing software DRM based on blockchain

Each time you generate a DRM license for an application, you only need to use 0.00131544 SOL (about $0.19 now) in rent and spend about 0.000005 SOL (basically negligible) in transaction fees.
If you no longer need the DRM license, you can release the rent and return the SOL.
